# Scheme_Capstone

## This repository contains all files involved in the creation of a Scheme self-interpreter for my Capstone project.

### Progress

15 August 2020:

I have just installed the latest version of Scheme (and the Petite version) on my laptop, and have successfully configured emacs with this version of Scheme. 

9 October 2020:

After a long while of not updating this repository, I have managed to learn and familiarize myself with Scheme, write out a basic interpreter with the help of my Capstone advisor Professor 
Danvy, and have written out the AST, Unparsers and some internal primitive functions that should be inside the environment of Scheme (pre-defined functions)
